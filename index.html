    		<h1>Sunday, Bloody Sunday</h1>
    		<h2>By U2, 1983</h2><br>
    		<p>I can't believe the news today<br>
			Oh, I can't close my eyes and make it go away <br>
			<br>
			How long?<br>
			How long must we sing this song?<br>
			How long? How long?<br>
			Cause tonight, we can be as one, tonight<br>
			<br>
			Broken bottles under children's feet<br>
			Bodies strewn across the dead end street<br>
			But I won't heed the battle call<br>
			It puts my back up, puts my back up against the wall<br><br>
			Sunday, bloody Sunday<br>
			Sunday, bloody Sunday<br>
			Sunday, bloody Sunday<br>
			Sunday, bloody Sunday<br>
			All right, let's go<br>
			</p>
